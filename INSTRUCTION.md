# Project Instructions

### This guide will help you set up and run scripts in this project. Please follow the steps sequentially for proper setup.

## 1. Preparation:

#### To begin, ensure you grant the necessary execution permissions to the files in the directory by running:
```bash
python3 chmod_script.py
```

## 2. Script Execution:

#### Manual Execution: After completing the first step, you're free to manually run any desired scripts within the directory.

#### Using the installer.py Interface: If you prefer to use an interface to choose and execute files, simply run:
```bash
python3 installer.py
```

#### This command initiates an interface for script selection and execution.

## 3. Automated Execution:

#### If you wish to grant execution permissions to all files and immediately run them, execute the following:
```bash
python3 chmod_and_run.py
```

### Note: Ensure Python 3 and other necessary dependencies are installed for successful script execution.

#### We hope this instruction proves valuable to you and any other users of the project.
